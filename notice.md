With great sadness I have decided to shutdown GeoBingo.io tonight. As most of you probably know the Google Maps API is not cheap and I have been paying most of the cost for the server and the API by myself with the help of donations which I am immensely grateful for <3 But it has reached a point where it would be stupid to continue like that. I put a lot of time and resources into this project of mine and seeing the bill go up every month has been demotivating for me and it has kept me from improving it further so I have been shifting my focus on other projects. I would love to keep the server running and it brings me joy to see people playing but for now I have to take the rational decision shut it down. For context you can look up the pricing on Google Maps API Pricing Site ([Platform Pricing & API Costs - Google Maps Platform](https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/)) . Thank you for all the good memories! 

# Will GeoBingo.io ever come back?
As of today nothing is planned but it might come back but not in the current form. Only time will tell.
